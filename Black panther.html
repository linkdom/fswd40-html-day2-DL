		<h2>Plot:</h2>
		<p>Centuries ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing vibranium.<br>One warrior ingests a "heart-shaped herb" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first "Black Panther".<br>He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda.<br>The Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a Third World country.<br>
		<br>
		In 1992, King T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in Oakland, California.<br>T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue with stealing vibranium from Wakanda.<br>N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri, another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions.<br>
		<br>
		In the present day, following T'Chaka's death,[N 1] his son T'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne.<br>He and Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, extract Nakia, T'Challa's ex-lover, from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda and younger sister Shuri.<br>At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat.<br>T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.<br>
		<br>
		After Klaue and Erik Stevens steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, W'Kabi, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover, urges him to bring Klaue back dead or alive.<br>T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross.<br>A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody.<br>Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization.<br>Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia.<br>Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.<br>
		<br>
		While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu.<br>Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors.<br>As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, N'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T'Chaka to kill him.<br>T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son, Erik, in order to maintain the lie.<br>Erik became a U.S. black ops soldier, adopting the name "Killmonger".<br>Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda.<br>He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity and claim to the throne.<br>Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat; after killing Zuri, he defeats T'Challa and hurls him over a waterfall, where he is presumed dead.<br>After ingesting the heart-shaped herb, Killmonger orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first.<br>Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.<br>
		<br>
		Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid.<br>They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life.<br>Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit and commands W'Kabi and his army to attack T'Challa.<br>Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje join T'Challa, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down the planes carrying the vibranium weapons.<br>M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa.<br>Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down.<br>Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him.<br>Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.<br>
		<br>
		T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died to be run by Nakia and Shuri.<br>In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his recuperation.</p>
