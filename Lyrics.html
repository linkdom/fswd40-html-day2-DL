	<h1>James Arthur - Train Wreck</h1>

	<div>
		<p>Laying in the silence<br>
	Waiting for the sirens<br>
	Signs, any signs I'm alive still<br>
	I don't wanna lose it<br>
	I'm not getting through this<br>
	Hey, should I pray? should I pray<br>
	To myself? To a God? <br>
	To a saviour who can<br> </p>
	</div>
	<span>
	<h4>Unbreak the broken<br>
	Unsay these spoken words<br>
	Find hope in the hopeless<br>
	Pull me out of the train wreck<br>
	Unburn the ashes<br>
	Unchain the reactions, I'm not ready to die, not yet<br>
	Pull me out of the train wreck<br>
	Pull me out, pull me out, pull me out<br>
	Pull me out, pull me out<br></h4>
	</span>
	<div>
	<p>Underneath our bad blood<br>
	We still got a sanctum, home<br>
	Still a home, still a home here<br>
	It's not too late to build it back<br>
	'Cause a one-in-a-million chance<br>
	Is still a chance, still a chance<br>
	And I would take those odds<br></p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<p>You can say what you like 'cause see, I would die for you<br>
	I, I'm down on my knees and I need you to be my God<br>
	Be my help, be a savior who can<br>
	Unbreak the broken<br>
	Unsay these reckless words (find hope in the hopeless)<br>
	Pull me out of the train wreck<br>
	Unburn the ashes<br>
	Unchain the reactions, I'm not ready to die, not yet<br>
	Pull me out of the train wreck<br>
	Pull me out, pull me out, pull me out<br>
